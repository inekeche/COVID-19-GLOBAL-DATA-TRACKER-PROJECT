# COVID-19-GLOBAL-DATA-TRACKER-PROJECT



# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores global COVID-19 trends using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). It provides insights into cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across selected countries through visualizations and data analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze trends in total and daily COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Explore and compare vaccination progress between countries
- Calculate key metrics like death rate and % vaccinated population
- Visualize findings through line charts, bar charts, and optional heatmaps or pie charts
- Summarize meaningful insights from the data

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – data manipulation
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – plotting & visualization
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – statistical plotting

💡 Insights & Reflections
Countries with higher vaccination rates saw significant drops in new deaths.

The U.S. had one of the fastest vaccine rollouts early on, though case numbers remained high due to transmission variants.

Death rate trends stabilized after initial pandemic waves, with wide differences between countries.

Strong correlation observed between total cases and deaths; however, some countries showed high case counts but lower fatality rates—likely due to improved healthcare or under-reporting early on.

📁 This project is intended for educational and exploratory data analysis purposes.
